# ShroomSprint  

This is a game I fully developed by myself using Unity.  
Only the SFX and music were AI-generated or sourced from various free sound effect websites like [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/).  
All assets are created by myself as well.  

A full playthrough can be seen here: [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpK8b5LNJLE)
